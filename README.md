# CryptoClustering
Module 19 Challenge - UWA Data Analytics Bootcamp

This repository contains a main code file titled "Crypto_Clustering_Main_Code.ipynb". This code performs unsupervised learning clustering on a dataset contained within the "Resources" file.

The code prepares the data with StandardScaler before using the elbow method to find the best value for 'k'. It then clusters the data based on the best value of 'k'.
It then repeats the process after performing a PCA and compares the two different clustering results.
